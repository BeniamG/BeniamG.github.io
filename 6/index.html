	<p>Ben Gebre-Medhin is an organizatioanl sociologist of higher education. He is 
	currently a PhD Candiate in Sociology at UC Berkeley where he is afiilated the
	Institute for Study of Social Issues and the D-Lab.  </p>

	<p>In New London, report says, the young men are falling into drinking habits
	as never before. So in New Haven, Bridgeport, and the other cities and
	large places of the state.</p>

	<p>"The pulse of a person in health beats about seventy strokes a minute, and
	the ordinary term of life is about seventy years. In these seventy years,
	the pulse of a temperate person beats two billion five hundred and
	seventy-four million four hundred and forty thousand times. If no actual
	disorganization should happen, a drunken person might live until his pulse
	beat this number of times; but by the constant stimulus of ardent spirits,
	or by pulse-quickening food, or tobacco, the pulse becomes greatly
	accelerated, and the two billion five hundred and seventy-four million
	four hundred and forty thousand pulsations are performed in little more
	than half the ordinary term of human life, and life goes out in forty or
	forty-five years, instead of seventy. This application of numbers is given
	to show that the acceleration of those forces diminishes the term of human
	life."</p>

	<p>"In New York, Mr. Greeley states that 'a much larger proportion of adult
	males in the state drink now than did in 1840-44.' After speaking of the
	adverse demonstrations all over the country, he adds, 'I cannot recall a
	single decisive, cheering success, to offset these many reverses.'</p>

	<p>"Massachusetts is moving to build an asylum for her twenty-five thousand
	drunkards. Lager beer brewers at Boston Highlands have three millions of
	dollars invested in the business, manufactured four hundred and
	ninety-five thousand barrels last year, and paid a tax of half a million
	to the general government. The city of Chicago, last year, received into
	her treasury one hundred and ten thousand dollars for the sale of
	indulgences to sell intoxicating drinks.</p>

	<p>"The same rate of fearful expenditure for intoxicating drinks extends
	across the ocean. In a speech before the Trades' Union Congress, last
	October, at Birmingham, 'on the disorganization of labor,' Mr. Potter
	shows drunkenness to be the great disorganizer of the labor of Great
	Britain, at a yearly cost of two hundred and twenty-eight million pounds,
	equal to one billion one hundred and forty million dollars; enough," he
	adds, "to pay the public debt of Great Britain in less than five years,
	and greatly diminish taxation forever."</p>
